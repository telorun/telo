`Telo.Application` accepts `variables:` / `secrets:` with per-field `env:` mapping; values resolve at `kernel.load()` into the root `variables.X` / `secrets.X` CEL scope before any controller or import initialises. `type:` supports `string | integer | number | boolean | object | array` — object and array values are JSON-decoded from a single env var. Coercion / schema / missing-required failures aggregate into one `ERR_MANIFEST_VALIDATION_FAILED` at load.

`Telo.Library` variables / secrets remain pure JSON Schema property maps. An `env:` key on a Library entry is now rejected at load time with a `LIBRARY_ENV_KEY_REJECTED` diagnostic that explains importers must supply the value.

The Telo editor's Deployment tab now renders the Application's declared environment contract above the free-form env vars list, so authors see exactly which env vars the manifest binds. The tab still drives the existing Run feature's env wiring — no manifest mutation.

`Config.Env` is deprecated in favour of the new Application-level shape. The kind continues to work; the controller logs a deprecation notice at init and the docs page is marked deprecated. Migrating consumers is recommended but not forced.

Diagnostics that target a missing child property now squiggle just the parent key identifier instead of the whole value block. `buildPositionIndex` additionally records map keys under the `@key:<path>` namespace, and the IDE range resolver prefers that key range when the leaf path isn't indexed.
