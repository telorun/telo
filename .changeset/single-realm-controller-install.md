Single-realm controller install: every controller in a kernel process now resolves through one `<entry-manifest-dir>/.telo/npm/` tree, with the kernel's own `@telorun/sdk` wired in as a `file:` dep. The realpath collapse this produces fixes class-identity bugs across the kernel/controller boundary — most visibly cel-js's `registerType("Stream", Stream)` matching `Stream` instances created on either side of the realm split.

- `@telorun/kernel`: `Kernel.load(url)` records the entry URL; `getEntryUrl()` is exposed via `ResourceContext`. `NpmControllerLoader` rewrites every load — registry tag or `local_path` — as an `npm install <spec>` into the per-manifest install root. A filesystem lock at `<root>/.lock` (atomic `fs.open(path, 'wx')`, PID + start-time inside) makes the install cross-process safe; a hash of the materialized `package.json` short-circuits repeat installs. The legacy `~/.cache/telo/npm/` global cache is no longer consulted (existing trees are safe to delete by hand). `TELO_PKG_MANAGER` overrides the default `npm` invocation.
- `@telorun/cli`: `telo install` passes the manifest's entry URL through to the kernel-side loader so the install root lands next to the manifest. `TELO_CACHE_DIR` is no longer consumed.
- `@telorun/sdk`: `ResourceContext` gains a `getEntryUrl()` method.
- `@telorun/assert`: `package.json` `exports` map now declares the Bun/Node conditional split (`bun → src/*.ts`, `import → dist/*.js`). The previous bare-`./src/*.ts` entries only worked because the old controller loader silently rewrote `src→dist`; that rewriter is gone.
