# Changelog
## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-30
### Added
* Publish as a layered artifact: `telo.yaml` in its own blob, one blob per bundled-controller platform selector, one for author-claimed `assets:`, and one for everything else. A consumer fetches only the layers it needs, and a bundled controller now materializes at resolve time — so a cold `telo run` works on the first try instead of failing until a second run had populated the cache.## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Drop `metadata.namespace`. A module's location is the ref it is published under, never anything it declares about itself, and nothing reads the field any more.## 0.2.1 - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
* Rewrite the library and kind descriptions for the hub's semantic search: each one now states what it does in a single paragraph, without kind names, references to the modules that implement it, or wording that only made sense against the module's history.
Declare `metadata.categories` — the domain labels the hub groups its browse view by and the editor filters its resource picker with.## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Initial release. putIfAbsent is SET NX PX; the two compare-and-* operations are generic Lua scripts that compare a revision and know nothing about the value, so every consumer reuses them. No fallback store — a conditional write served from a second, unsynchronised store would let two callers both believe they won. Requires `maxmemory-policy noeviction`.## 0.1.0
