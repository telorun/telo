### Patch Changes

- f3b044d: Remove `metadata.namespace` as a structural field. Five subsystems read it;
  each now uses something the module already has.

  `x-telo-ref` names its target as an **alias-qualified kind** — the same grammar
  `kind:` and `extends:` use: `KvStore.Store` for a module in this file's
  `imports:` map, `Self.Store` for a kind in this library, `Telo.Invocable` for a
  built-in. The analyzer canonicalizes each constraint in the _declaring_ module's
  scope before registration, so the definition registry answers ref queries with
  no module context and a constraint stays correct whatever alias a consumer
  picks. The legacy `"<namespace>/<module>#<Kind>"` identity form still resolves
  for already-published module versions and now warns as
  `X_TELO_REF_LEGACY_IDENTITY`; `metadata.namespace` feeds nothing else.

  A constraint whose prefix names no alias is now `X_TELO_REF_UNRESOLVED` (or
  `KIND_NOT_EXPORTED` when the alias is known but the target gates the kind),
  quoting the slot's path and the aliases in scope. Previously — and for the old
  identity form before it — an unresolvable constraint made the reference check
  treat the slot as partial context and skip it, so a typo silently let the slot
  accept any resource. All three diagnostics are scoped to the modules the author
  can edit, so a published dependency never reports against its consumers.

  Definition schema `$id`s move onto `telo://<module>/<Name>`, the scheme named
  `Telo.Type`s already register under. One id space per module means a kind and a
  named type may no longer share a name; that collision is reported as
  `DUPLICATE_SCHEMA_ID` rather than silently dropping the type's schema.

  Version reconciliation keys on the **import ref minus its version** rather than
  `<namespace>/<name>`, so OCI and `https://` modules are hoisted for the first
  time and two same-named modules published to different origins are no longer
  conflated. A relative path addresses one file on disk, not a published
  location, and is not reconciled.

  `Transport.cacheLocation` is replaced by `Transport.cacheCoords`, returning the
  `{ transport, host, path, version }` coordinates that `manifestCacheKey`
  renders. The local manifest cache therefore uses the same layout as the
  discovery hub's static bucket:
  `.telo/manifests/<transport>/<host>/<path…>/<version>/<file>`. Registry entries
  now carry the registry host, so two registries' copies of one path and version
  no longer share a cache entry. **Existing `.telo/manifests` trees are orphaned
  by the new layout and are re-downloaded on the next `telo install`.**

  `telo publish` derives a relative sibling import's ref from the publish
  destination — the destination's last segment is the module's own directory, so
  `../bar` under `oci://ghcr.io/acme/foo` resolves to `oci://ghcr.io/acme/bar` —
  and reads only the sibling's version from its manifest. `SiblingIdentity` is
  gone.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 942c176: Resolve provider-shaped `!ref` slots through `ctx.resolveRef` instead of a
  per-module copy of the same two-branch logic.

  The removed wrappers (`resolveCacheStore`, `resolveShellHost`,
  `resolveVectorStore`, `resolveEmbeddingModel`, `resolveJournal`) were one-line
  shims; call sites now pass the module's own type guard and the slot's `x-telo-ref`
  contract, so a mis-wire names the owning resource and what the slot wanted —
  `` Cache.Entry "page": 'store' … did not resolve to a resource satisfying
`std/cache#Store`  ``. Each module still
  exports its guard (`isCacheStore`, `isShellHost`, `isVectorStore`,
  `isEmbeddingModel`, `isJournalStore`, `isSqlConnection`) for consumers that
  resolve the slot themselves; `isJournalStore` is now duck-typed rather than
  `instanceof`, so it survives two copies of the package in one process.

  `resolveSqlConnection` stays — it encodes the optional-slot rule that lets a
  `Sql.Query` fall back to its `transaction` — and now takes a `describe` argument,
  so its six call sites report the owning resource instead of a bare `Sql:` prefix.
  Ref-typed manifest fields use the SDK's `KindRef<T>` rather than a hand-rolled
  `{ name, alias }`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 06c675b: `Shell.Command` / `Shell.CommandStream` gain an injection-safe **argv** form and env **unset**. Pass `args: [program, ...arguments]` (mutually exclusive with `command`) to exec a program directly with no shell, so an untrusted argument (a user- or agent-chosen path) can never be reinterpreted as shell syntax. A `null` value in `env` (per-call or a host's base `env:`) now **unsets** an inherited variable instead of setting it — the only way to keep a variable the parent holds (e.g. a secret) out of the spawned child. The `ShellHost.exec` seam now takes a `CommandSpec` (`{ command }` | `{ args }`) so every driver gets both forms.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bc7d241: Add the shell module: run shell commands behind a transport-neutral `Shell.Host` abstraction — `Shell.Command` (buffered), `Shell.CommandStream` (streaming), and the bundled `Shell.LocalHost` driver.
