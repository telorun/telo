# @telorun/debug-ui

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9ef48a6: Add a live debug-event inspection UI. `telo run --inspect` starts a
  localhost-only inspection endpoint and prints its URL — a single page that
  watches the kernel event stream in real time (SSE), with text/kind/suffix
  filtering, expandable payloads, pause, and replay of events that fired before
  the page was opened. (`--debug` independently writes the `.telo.debug.jsonl`
  event log; the two compose. See the `--inspect` flag set for delivery details.)

  New `@telorun/debug-ui` package: the browser-safe, runtime-agnostic consumer
  surface — the debug wire-format types + JSON Schema, filter logic, an SSE client,
  and React components (incl. the standalone app served by the inspection server).
  It has no Node-only dependency so it also runs in the editor webview.

  Binary payloads (images and any other file kind) are not inlined: the producer
  offloads each `Uint8Array`/`Buffer` to an in-memory, content-addressed LRU blob
  store and emits a small `{ "$blob": "blobs/<id>", "mediaType", "byteLength" }`
  pointer in its place (the key it sits under is preserved). The `DebugServer`
  serves the bytes at `GET /blobs/:id`; the UI renders `image/*` inline and other
  types as download links. Content addressing dedupes repeated buffers (e.g. a
  redraw loop).

  The producer (serializer + `DebugServer` + blob store) stays Node-side in the
  CLI; the cross-runtime contract is the wire format
  (`@telorun/debug-ui/wire-schema.json`), so a future Rust/Go kernel can serve the
  same UI by conforming to it. The inspection server binds `127.0.0.1` and is
  `unref`'d, so a one-shot `--inspect` run still exits normally.

- 9ef48a6: Ship the debug UI on demand instead of bundling it in the CLI, and give the
  inspection endpoint its own composable flag set.

  - `telo run --inspect[=[host:]port]` starts the live inspection endpoint
    (default `127.0.0.1:9230`; non-loopback binds print a security warning) and
    serves the UI same-origin, with a `/json/version` discovery handshake.
    `--no-open` suppresses auto-opening the browser. `--debug` is a separate,
    composable flag that writes only the `.telo.debug.jsonl` event log (no network,
    no UI).
  - The CLI does not bundle `@telorun/debug-ui` (it's a `devDependency`). The UI is
    fetched on demand from npm via jsDelivr and cached under the `.telo` cache
    root; in the monorepo it resolves from the workspace, so local builds are
    testable offline. `TELO_DEBUG_UI_PATH` overrides the bundle path; `TELO_DEBUG_UI_URL`
    overrides the CDN base.
  - `@telorun/debug-ui` builds a self-contained single-file bundle
    (`app-single/index.html`) alongside `app-dist/`.
