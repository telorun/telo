# @telorun/runner-core

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 721a241: Operator-predefined app catalog: runners advertise launchable applications on `/v1/capabilities` (`apps`) and `POST /v1/sessions` accepts `app: <name>` instead of a bundle — the runner resolves the image and injects the app's operator env server-side, all from the `RUNNER_APPS` JSON config (no app is built in; runners know nothing about any specific application). Replaces the `TELO_SELF_CONTAINED` sentinel; k8s-runner runs app sessions as direct pods (no image build) under separate `RUNNER_APP_MAX_*` ceilings

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 897c0b9: Surface session port reachability on the endpoint badge instead of the log stream.

  After a session goes running, the runner (`watchReachability` in
  `@telorun/runner-core`, used by the k8s and docker backends) probes each declared
  tcp port and emits a structured `reachability` `RunEvent` per port — `checking`,
  then `reachable`, or `unreachable` after a 30s timeout (flipping back to
  `reachable` if it recovers). The editor renders this on each endpoint link in the
  debug panel: a spinner while checking, a green icon when reachable, a red icon
  when unreachable — turning the loopback-bind / wrong-port failure (previously an
  opaque downstream 502, or a late log line) into live status on the URL itself.

  The badge reflects reachability from the runner to the workload (pod network for
  k8s, published port / container for docker) — a proxy for the common loopback-bind
  failure, not end-to-end health of the public link, and a startup signal rather
  than continuous monitoring (a port that comes up then dies keeps its green icon).

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a125804]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.3.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a8c99ab]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.2.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bc2eeff: Session ids are now short 12-character base32 strings (e.g. `k7m3qx9r2abc`) instead of 36-character UUIDs. The shorter id keeps `<id>.<domain>` session hostnames and `telo-run-<id>` container/pod names compact while staying DNS- and Kubernetes-name-safe. Generated centrally via `generateSessionId`; ids remain opaque to clients.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2558e41: k8s-runner: add a base-image picker resolved from a filtered Docker Hub tag catalog and validated server-side, and make `pullPolicy` a live base-image freshness control — `always` digest-pins the build so a moved moving-tag (e.g. `latest-slim`) rebuilds. Adds a generic `BaseImageCatalog` + `resolveTagDigest` and a `validateConfig` server hook to runner-core.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8133912: Retain exited sessions long enough for the editor to re-attach and replay a run's console + inspection history after a page reload. The exit-eviction TTL default goes from 5 minutes to 4 hours, the max retained sessions default from 8 to 32, and at capacity the registry now evicts the oldest _terminal_ session before rejecting a new run (live sessions are never evicted), so a long TTL never blocks a new run.
- 8133912: Add operator-defined, server-enforced usage terms. A runner advertises `terms` on `/v1/capabilities` (sourced from `RUNNER_TERMS_FILE` or inline `RUNNER_TERMS_BODY`, with the version defaulting to a content hash) and rejects `POST /v1/sessions` with `428 terms_required` unless the client sends the `x-telo-accepted-terms` header matching the current version. runner-core gains `loadTermsFromEnv`, the `RunnerTerms` type, the `ACCEPTED_TERMS_HEADER` constant, and the `terms` capability field. docker-runner reads terms from the environment (off by default); k8s-runner wires them through the Helm chart via a terms ConfigMap.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d59e847]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.1.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e6e8d88: Unify the docker and kubernetes runners behind a `/v1/capabilities` discovery
  endpoint. Runners advertise their own editable config schema; the editor
  collapses the docker-api and k8s adapters into a single capability-driven
  http-runner adapter with managed add/edit/remove/switch runners, and preflights
  required variables/secrets before a run.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dc20d0: Add a Kubernetes runner. Extract backend-neutral `@telorun/runner-core` from docker-runner (shared `/v1` contract, routes, registry, SSE, ring buffers) behind a `RunnerBackend` seam; docker-runner becomes a thin backend over it with no behaviour change. Add `@telorun/k8s-runner`, a `KubernetesBackend` that runs Telo apps as sandboxed Pods (attach-based PTY, hard-ceiling limit clamping, tokenized bundle delivery, per-session ingress, orphan reaping) plus a Helm chart (RBAC, quota, NetworkPolicy) and a CI image job. Add a k8s editor `RunAdapter` via a shared `createHttpRunnerAdapter` factory. Rename the docker image `telorun/telo-runner` → `telorun/docker-runner`.
