# Changelog
## 0.10.0 - 2026-08-09
### Added
* metadata.name is now Shell, so the module contributes its kinds under the `Shell.<Kind>` canonical prefix instead of `shell.<Kind>` — a name rather than a slug, in the PascalCase form the manifest grammar asks for. Importers are unaffected: a kind is always written through the import alias the consumer picks (`<Alias>.<Kind>`), and the `exports.kinds` list is unchanged. Only a manifest that names the canonical `<module>.<Kind>` form directly — a legacy bare-string `x-telo-ref`, or a diagnostic matched by its text — sees the new prefix.## 0.9.0 - 2026-08-08
### Added
* Every `x-telo-ref` slot now declares what this module does with the target: `use: dependency` (held and read), `call` (control transfers during the invocation and returns), `detached`, `trigger.inbound`, `trigger.consumer`, or `schema` for a slot that only names a shape. Slots that accepted `Telo.Invocable | Telo.Runnable` through an `anyOf` now say `Telo.Executable`, the new built-in parent of both. Wiring manifests are unchanged — this is schema metadata, and it is what lets `telo check` answer whether control reaches a referenced resource, and when.## 0.8.0 - 2026-08-01
### Added
* The controller now ships inside the module artifact as a bundle (pkg:telo/local/js) instead of being fetched from npm at load. Importing this module needs no npm registry at run time, and its version is a single number again: metadata.version. The kernel builds the controller from source while the module is a working copy, so a checkout needs no build step.## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-31
### Added
* Data shapes are declared with the kernel built-in `Telo.JsonSchema` instead of `Type.JsonSchema`, so the module no longer imports `std/type` to describe its own contracts. Identical behaviour; `Type.JsonSchema` still resolves for anyone who prefers it, though the `type` module is now deprecated.## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Reference slots name their target as an alias-qualified kind (`<Alias>.<Kind>`, `Self.<Kind>`, `Telo.<Kind>`) instead of the `<namespace>/<module>#<Kind>` identity string, so a constraint resolves through this module's own `imports:` map and stays pinned to the version it imports. `metadata.namespace` is dropped — a module's location is the ref it is published under, never anything it declares about itself.
### Fixed
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.3.1.## 0.5.1 - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
* Rewrite the library and kind descriptions for the hub's semantic search: each one now states what it does in a single paragraph, without kind names, references to the modules that implement it, or wording that only made sense against the module's history.
Declare `metadata.categories` — the domain labels the hub groups its browse view by and the editor filters its resource picker with.## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.3.0.## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-19
### Added
* Declare repository and license in module metadata, published as org.opencontainers.image.* annotations on OCI.## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-18
### Added
* Declare `exports.kinds` explicitly, listing every kind the module already exported implicitly, and add a `metadata.description` to every exported kind (and exported resource) so the discovery hub can index them for semantic search. No change to what importers can reference — the module previously relied on the loader treating an absent `exports.kinds` as "export everything", and now states its public kind surface outright.## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-06
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.2.0.## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-30
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.1.0.## 0.0.0
