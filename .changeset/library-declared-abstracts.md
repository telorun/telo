kernel/analyzer: library-declared Telo.Abstract + first-class `extends` + in-place invoke wrap.

- Kernel: new runtime meta-controller for `kind: Telo.Abstract` so libraries can declare abstract contracts that importers resolve at runtime (not just in static analysis). Fixes the latent "No controller registered for kind 'Telo.Abstract'" failure when importing modules like `std/workflow` that declare an abstract.
- Kernel: `_createInstance` now overrides `invoke` in-place on the controller's returned instance instead of wrapping it in a new object. The previous `{ ...instance, invoke }` shape (and a later prototype-preserving variant) split object identity: `init()` ran on the wrapper while the wrapper's `invoke` delegated back to the original instance, so any state `init` set on `this` was invisible at invocation time. Mutating in place keeps all lifecycle methods on the same object and incidentally preserves the prototype chain for class-based controllers.
- Analyzer: `Telo.Definition` gains an `extends: "<Alias>.<Abstract>"` field (alias-form, resolved against the declaring file's `Telo.Import` declarations — same pattern as kind prefixes). This pins the target's module version through the import source. `DefinitionRegistry.extendedBy` is populated from both `extends` and `capability` (union-merged), so third-party modules using the legacy `capability: <UserAbstract>` overload keep working. A `CAPABILITY_SHADOWS_EXTENDS` warning prompts migration.
- Analyzer: new `validateExtends` pass emits `EXTENDS_MALFORMED` / `EXTENDS_UNKNOWN_TARGET` / `EXTENDS_NON_ABSTRACT` / `CAPABILITY_SHADOWS_EXTENDS` diagnostics. The pass skips defs forwarded from imported libraries — those are validated in their own analysis context, where the source library's aliases are in scope.
- Analyzer: Phase 1 registration loop now also registers `kind: Telo.Abstract` docs (previously only `Telo.Definition`), so cross-package `x-telo-ref` references to library-declared abstracts actually resolve.
- Analyzer + kernel: the `Telo.Abstract` schema is now open (`additionalProperties: true`) — abstracts carry `schema` plus any forward-compatible fields (e.g. `inputType` / `outputType` from the typed-abstracts plan). `controllers` and `throws` remain forbidden on abstracts.
- Loader: imported libraries' `Telo.Import` docs are now forwarded alongside their `Telo.Definition` / `Telo.Abstract` docs. Alias resolution remains the analyzer's responsibility — the loader just exposes the imports.
- Analyzer: alias resolution is now per-scope. The consumer's aliases live in the main resolver; each imported library gets its own `AliasResolver` built from the `Telo.Import` docs forwarded under its `metadata.module`. Forwarded defs' `extends` and `capability` are normalized in their declaring library's scope, so `extendedBy` stays keyed by canonical kind even when a consumer imports the same dependency under a different alias name (or omits a transitive dependency it doesn't directly use).
- SDK: `ResourceDefinition` type gains `extends?: string`.
- Assert: `Assert.Manifest` supports `expect.warnings` alongside `expect.errors`.
- Migration: `modules/workflow-temporal/telo.yaml` moves from `capability: Workflow.Backend` to canonical `capability: Telo.Provider, extends: Workflow.Backend`, and gains a self-referential `Telo.Import` (`name: Workflow, source: ../workflow`) so the alias on `extends` resolves against the library's own imports. No behavioural change for existing consumers.
