Added port exposure to the Run feature. The Deployment view has an "Exposed ports" editor next to "Environment variables"; both the in-process Tauri Docker adapter and the remote `@telorun/docker-runner` HTTP service publish the configured ports (`-p port:port/protocol` / Docker API `PortBindings`) when a session starts. The Run view header shows one clickable `host:port` chip per exposed port; the host is resolved from `DOCKER_HOST` (Tauri adapter) or from the runner's base URL (HTTP adapter). `RunStatus.running` now carries an optional `endpoints` array describing where the container is reachable.
