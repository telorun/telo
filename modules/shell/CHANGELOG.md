# Changelog
## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-31
### Added
* Data shapes are declared with the kernel built-in `Telo.JsonSchema` instead of `Type.JsonSchema`, so the module no longer imports `std/type` to describe its own contracts. Identical behaviour; `Type.JsonSchema` still resolves for anyone who prefers it, though the `type` module is now deprecated.## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Reference slots name their target as an alias-qualified kind (`<Alias>.<Kind>`, `Self.<Kind>`, `Telo.<Kind>`) instead of the `<namespace>/<module>#<Kind>` identity string, so a constraint resolves through this module's own `imports:` map and stays pinned to the version it imports. `metadata.namespace` is dropped — a module's location is the ref it is published under, never anything it declares about itself.
### Fixed
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.3.1.## 0.5.1 - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
* Rewrite the library and kind descriptions for the hub's semantic search: each one now states what it does in a single paragraph, without kind names, references to the modules that implement it, or wording that only made sense against the module's history.
Declare `metadata.categories` — the domain labels the hub groups its browse view by and the editor filters its resource picker with.## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.3.0.## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-19
### Added
* Declare repository and license in module metadata, published as org.opencontainers.image.* annotations on OCI.## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-18
### Added
* Declare `exports.kinds` explicitly, listing every kind the module already exported implicitly, and add a `metadata.description` to every exported kind (and exported resource) so the discovery hub can index them for semantic search. No change to what importers can reference — the module previously relied on the loader treating an absent `exports.kinds` as "export everything", and now states its public kind surface outright.## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-06
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.2.0.## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-30
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/shell to 0.1.0.## 0.0.0
