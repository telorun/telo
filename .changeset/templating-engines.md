Introduce per-property templating engines via YAML tags. New `@telorun/templating` package owns the shared CEL core (compile, chain validator, walker, environment) and a pluggable engine registry. Two built-in engines ship: `!cel` (single CEL expression — no `${{ }}` wrapping) and `!literal` (opaque text — no interpolation, no analysis). Untagged `${{ }}` strings continue to compile as CEL exactly as before. The kernel, analyzer, telo editor, and VS Code extension now share one source of truth for engine registration and YAML tag parsing.
