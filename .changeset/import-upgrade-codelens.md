Surface outdated `imports:` entries in the IDE, the way the telo editor's Imports view already does.

`@telorun/analyzer` gains `newestModuleVersion(versions, { includePrerelease })` beside `isNewerModuleVersion`. Both halves of an upgrade check have to come from one rule: a host that decides "behind" through the shared ordering but reads "latest" off the head of a version list is answering with whatever order its index happened to return. For a module whose newest tag is a prerelease, list-order said the import was behind while the ordering rule said it was current — the same manifest against the same hub, two answers. Unparseable tags (an OCI digest, a moving `latest`) are dropped rather than ordered, and prereleases are excluded unless asked for, matching `telo upgrade`'s default. The editor's Imports view now derives its "latest" through it, so its badge no longer offers `-rc` builds as automatic upgrade targets; the per-import dropdown still lists every version for a deliberate pick.

`@telorun/ide-support` gains `buildImportUpgrades(text, listVersions, docs?)` — a host-neutral builder that locates every `imports:` entry of a module document, asks a caller-supplied `ModuleVersionLookup` for each distinct base ref's versions, and returns the source edits that re-point the ones that are behind. Both authored shapes are handled: for the object form the now-stale `integrity:` line is deleted alongside the source rewrite, because the pin hashes the `telo.yaml` of the version being replaced and carrying it forward would turn the next install into a tamper error. An entry whose pin shares a line with other fields is reported as a skip — carrying its anchor and versions, so a host renders it in place of the upgrade affordance rather than showing nothing for an import that is behind.

The VS Code extension renders it as CodeLenses: a summary lens on the `imports:` key (`2 imports outdated · Upgrade all`), a per-entry lens (`↑ 0.9.0 → 1.0.0`), and a warning lens for a skip. Version lists come from the hub, memoized so lens resolution stays off the keystroke path — failures are memoized too, on a shorter clock, or an unreachable hub would fire a request per base ref on every keystroke. A click that changes nothing now says which of the three reasons applied: a lookup that failed, a skip that named a reason, or genuinely current. Hub failures go to a new `Telo` output channel, reachable from the failure notification. New setting `telo.importUpgrades.enabled` turns the feature and its hub traffic off; new command `Telo: Check Imports for Updates` drops the memo and re-checks.

`@telorun/cli` drops its private copy of the module-kind list in favour of the analyzer's `isModuleKind`.
