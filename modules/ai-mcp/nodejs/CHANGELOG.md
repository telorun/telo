### Minor Changes

- c1432a6: ai: `Ai.Agent` tool-use loop + `Ai.ToolProvider` / `Ai.Tools`, with MCP discovery via `@telorun/ai-mcp`

  Adds a tool-use agent to the AI module. `Ai.Agent` (`Telo.Invocable`) runs a buffered
  loop over any `Ai.Model`: it advertises a tool set, executes the tools the model
  requests, replays the results, and loops until the model produces a final answer or
  `maxSteps` is reached. The loop lives in the controller (provider-agnostic, observable
  via the returned `steps` trace), not in the provider.

  Tools come from one field, `toolProviders` — a list of `Ai.ToolProvider` references.
  `Ai.ToolProvider` is a new `Telo.Abstract` (`capability: Telo.Mount`) exposing
  `listTools()` / `callTool()`; the agent mounts providers the way `Http.Server` mounts
  `Http.Api`s. Two implementations ship:

  - `Ai.Tools` (in `@telorun/ai`) — a static list of tools, each wrapping any
    `Telo.Invocable`, with a required model-facing `parameters` schema and optional
    `inputs:`/`result:` CEL mappings for invocables whose call shape diverges.
  - `AiMcp.ToolProvider` (new package `@telorun/ai-mcp`) — discovers a whole MCP server's
    tools at run time (`tools/list` → descriptors, `tools/call` → dispatch). It is the only
    module depending on both `@telorun/ai` and `@telorun/mcp-client`; the `ai` core stays
    MCP-agnostic and `mcp-client` stays a pure transport.

  The `Ai.Model` contract is extended additively: optional `tools` on input, optional
  `toolCalls` on output, a `tool` message role with `toolCallId` correlation, and a
  `tool-calls` finishReason. `Ai.Text` / `Ai.TextStream` never pass tools and are
  unaffected. `@telorun/ai-openai` wires tools through Vercel `generateText({ tools })`
  and translates the tool-role / assistant-tool-call messages.

  Loop bounds are configurable: `maxSteps` (default 8), `onMaxSteps` (`throw` | `return`,
  default `throw`), and `onToolError` (`feedback` | `throw`, default `feedback` — a failed
  or unknown tool is recorded in `steps` and returned to the model so it can recover,
  never silently swallowed).

  Analyzer fix (patch): seed the `Self` alias for every module that contributes
  definitions, not only modules whose `Telo.Library` doc is present in the flattened
  manifest set. `flattenForAnalyzer` forwards an imported library's definitions but not its
  module doc, so a kind declaring `extends: Self.<Abstract>` (an abstract in the same
  library) previously mis-keyed its `extendedBy` edge under the literal `"Self.<Abstract>"`
  when the library was imported rather than analyzed standalone. The bug stayed invisible
  until a second module implemented the same abstract (e.g. `Ai.Tools` + `AiMcp.ToolProvider`
  both implementing `Ai.ToolProvider`), at which point a valid reference to the
  `Self`-extending kind was wrongly rejected as not implementing the abstract.
