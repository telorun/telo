Add `telo install <path>` — pre-downloads every controller declared by a manifest and its transitive `Telo.Import`s into the on-disk cache. At runtime the kernel finds each controller already cached and skips the boot-time `npm install`, removing the startup delay and the network dependency from production containers.

Reuses the existing `ControllerLoader`, so resolution semantics (local_path, node_modules, npm fallback, entry resolution) are identical to runtime loading. Jobs run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`; failures are reported per controller and the command exits non-zero if any failed.

`ControllerLoader` is now exported from `@telorun/kernel`.

**Cache location**: defaults to `~/.cache/telo/` (XDG-style, shared across projects for a user). Override via `TELO_CACHE_DIR` — set it per-project to bundle the cache alongside the manifest. The registry image now uses `TELO_CACHE_DIR=/srv/.telo-cache` so `telo install` at build time and `telo run` at boot both read/write the same project-local cache, and a single `COPY --from=build /srv /srv` carries the full bundle into the production stage.
