## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 84e9edf: `telo publish` now canonicalizes relative `Telo.Import.source` paths (e.g. `../ai`) into absolute registry references of the form `<namespace>/<name>@<version>` before pushing the manifest. Relative paths are only meaningful on the publisher's filesystem; once a manifest reached the registry, the leading `..` collapsed the version segment of the registry URL (so e.g. a sibling import at `…/<package>/<version>/` + `../<sibling>` resolved to `…/<package>/<sibling>`, dropping the version), and any consumer that imported a published library which itself used relative imports got a 500 from the registry. Sibling-module metadata (`namespace` / `name` / `version`) is read from the local target's `telo.yaml` at publish time.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 0c4d023: Surface controller-download progress as kernel events and render them in the CLI.

  `ControllerLoading` / `ControllerLoaded` / `ControllerLoadFailed` /
  `ControllerLoadSkipped` are now emitted from `ControllerLoader` itself, one
  cycle per attempted PURL candidate so env-missing fallback chains are visible.
  Payloads carry the single attempted `purl` instead of the full candidate
  array, plus `source` (`local` | `node_modules` | `cache` | `npm-install` |
  `cargo-build`) and `durationMs` on `Loaded` so consumers can distinguish real
  work from cache hits. `pkg:cargo` resolutions through `local_path` (the only
  cargo mode currently wired up) report `source: "local"` — cargo's incremental
  cache makes every run after the first effectively a no-op build, the same
  mental model as the npm `local_path` branch. `cargo-build` is reserved for a
  future distribution mode (fetch from a registry + compile). `Skipped` is
  emitted for recoverable env-missing fallbacks (e.g. `pkg:cargo` with no
  `rustc` on PATH) so consumers can close out per-attempt UI state without
  conflating it with a hard failure.

  The CLI renders a `⬇ <purl>` line at `Loading` and rewrites it in place to
  `✓ <purl> (<source>, <ms>)` (or `✗ …`) at `Loaded` / `Failed`. By default the
  renderer activates only when stdout is a TTY, so CI logs and the dockerised
  `telorun/telo` service stay silent. `--verbose` forces rendering on regardless
  of TTY (so captured/piped logs get the lines too).

  By default, resolutions reporting `source: cache` or `local` have their line
  erased once `Loaded` arrives — they're sub-millisecond and don't represent
  work worth surfacing. `--verbose` bypasses this filter and prints every
  resolution, including cache/local, which is useful for debugging which branch
  the loader took. Other sources (`node_modules`, `npm-install`, `cargo-build`)
  always render their `✓` line.

  The cargo / napi loader now also accepts an optional PURL fragment. When
  present, `pkg:cargo/foo?local_path=...#bar` projects to `module.bar` after
  loading the dylib (each sub-export must itself have `create` or `register`);
  without a fragment the whole module is the controller, as before. This
  mirrors the npm `#entry` semantics for crates that want one source file per
  controller. The raw module is cached per crate, so two PURLs differing only
  by fragment share one cargo build.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e0ad31: In-memory kernel bootstrap and `Adapter` → `Source` rename.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `Kernel.loadFromConfig(path)` → `Kernel.load(url)`. The new method dispatches the URL through the registered `ManifestSource` chain unchanged — no implicit `file://` cwd-wrapping. The `loadDirectory` deprecation shim is removed.
  - `KernelOptions.sources: ManifestSource[]` is now required. Callers must pass an explicit list, e.g. `new Kernel({ sources: [new LocalFileSource()] })`. The previous hardcoded `LocalFileAdapter` registration in the `Kernel` constructor is gone.
  - `ManifestAdapter` interface renamed to `ManifestSource`. Per-scheme classes renamed: `LocalFileAdapter` → `LocalFileSource`, `HttpAdapter` → `HttpSource`, `RegistryAdapter` → `RegistrySource`. Files and directories renamed in turn (`manifest-adapters/` → `manifest-sources/`, `analyzer/.../adapters/` → `.../sources/`).
  - `LoaderInitOptions` field renames: `extraAdapters` → `extraSources`, `includeHttpAdapter` → `includeHttpSource`, `includeRegistryAdapter` → `includeRegistrySource`.
  - The dead-stub `kernel/nodejs/src/manifest-adapters/manifest-adapter.ts` (an unused parallel interface that drifted from the live one in `@telorun/analyzer`) is deleted.

  **New:**

  - `MemorySource`: an in-memory `ManifestSource` for embedders and tests. Available as a top-level export from `@telorun/kernel` and as a subpath export at `@telorun/kernel/memory-source`. Bare module names register under `<name>/telo.yaml` (mirroring disk's "module is a directory containing telo.yaml" convention) so relative imports (`./sub`, `../sibling`) work transparently with POSIX path resolution. `set(name, content)` accepts either YAML text or an array of parsed manifest objects (serialized via `yaml.stringify`).

  **Internal:**

  - `Loader.moduleCache` is now per-instance rather than `private static readonly`. Multiple in-process kernels (the headline use case for `MemorySource` — test runners, IDE previews) no longer share a process-wide cache.

### Patch Changes

- 2900b1c: `telo publish` now retries transient registry push failures with exponential backoff (up to 4 attempts). Retries on network errors (DNS, reset, `fetch failed`) and on `408`, `425`, `429`, and `5xx` responses so flaky CI pushes no longer fail the whole workflow.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a61dbf: Add `telo install <path>` — pre-downloads every controller declared by a manifest and its transitive `Telo.Import`s into the on-disk cache. At runtime the kernel finds each controller already cached and skips the boot-time `npm install`, removing the startup delay and the network dependency from production containers.

  Reuses the existing `ControllerLoader`, so resolution semantics (local_path, node_modules, npm fallback, entry resolution) are identical to runtime loading. Jobs run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`; failures are reported per controller and the command exits non-zero if any failed.

  `ControllerLoader` is now exported from `@telorun/kernel`.

  **Cache location**: defaults to `~/.cache/telo/` (XDG-style, shared across projects for a user). Override via `TELO_CACHE_DIR` — set it per-project to bundle the cache alongside the manifest. The registry image now uses `TELO_CACHE_DIR=/srv/.telo-cache` so `telo install` at build time and `telo run` at boot both read/write the same project-local cache, and a single `COPY --from=build /srv /srv` carries the full bundle into the production stage.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 3c4ac58: Resource initialization errors now carry the resource `kind`, an underlying error `code`, and a structured `details` block extracted from the original error — AWS SDK service exceptions expose HTTP status / request ID / fault, pg database errors expose severity / detail / hint / SQLSTATE / routine, Node system errors expose syscall / address / port, and the full `cause` chain is walked. The CLI renders runtime diagnostics distinctly from static-analysis diagnostics: no redundant file path, `kind` and `name` shown as the heading, details indented below.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d866be: Add `--skip-controllers` flag to `telo publish`. When set, skips the controller build/publish/PURL-rewrite loop and only runs static analysis and pushes the manifest to the Telo registry. Used by the Changesets-driven CI release flow, where controller packages are already published by `changeset publish`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 31d721e: feat: bearer-token auth for the Telo module registry publish endpoint

  The registry's `PUT /{namespace}/{name}/{version}` now requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Reads stay anonymous. Tokens are provisioned declaratively at boot via `TELO_PUBLISH_TOKEN` and stored as SHA-256 hashes in a `tokens` table joined to `users` and `namespaces`.

  **Analyzer** (`@telorun/analyzer`) — **breaking for direct API consumers**

  - `StaticAnalyzer` and `Loader` now accept an optional `{ celHandlers }` in their constructors. Analyzer-only callers (VS Code extension, Docusaurus preview, CLI `check`/`publish`) can omit it and get throwing stubs. Runtime callers (kernel) must supply real handlers.
  - The module-level `celEnvironment` singleton is removed — `precompile.ts` now takes the `Environment` as a parameter.
  - New CEL stdlib function: `sha256(string): string`. Always registered with the correct signature so `env.check()` type-checks; behaviour depends on the supplied handler.
  - The throws-union resolver recognises the new `throw:` step shape (see Run module) and resolves its code at the call site using the same rules as passthrough invocables (literal / `${{ 'LIT' }}` / `${{ error.code }}` in catch).
  - CEL type-check failures now surface as diagnostics. Previously the analyzer only reported schema/type mismatches on valid expressions; `env.check(...)` returning `{ valid: false }` (wrong method, wrong operand types, wrong overload — e.g. `s.slice(7)` on a dyn) was silently dropped. Now surfaces as `SCHEMA_VIOLATION` with a `CEL type error:` message.

  **Kernel** (`@telorun/kernel`)

  - Constructs `StaticAnalyzer` and `Loader` with a `node:crypto`-backed `sha256` handler, so CEL templates invoking `sha256()` evaluate at runtime.

  **Run module** (`@telorun/run`) — **breaking**

  - `Run.Sequence` gains a first-class `throw:` step variant: `- name: X; throw: { code, message?, data? }` — throws `InvokeError` directly from inside the sequence. Works inside `catch:` blocks via `code: "${{ error.code }}"` for re-raise. A malformed `throw.code` (non-string or empty after expansion) is itself reported as `InvokeError("INVALID_THROW_STEP", …)` rather than a plain Error, so the failure stays in the structured-error channel and a surrounding `catches:` can map it.
  - The `Run.Throw` invocable is removed. Existing `invoke: { kind: Run.Throw }` call sites must migrate to `throw:` steps. The separate kind was redundant with the new step form, and the `throw:` step expresses the intent more directly inside sequences.
  - **Event-stream change:** `throw:` steps do **not** emit a scoped `<Kind>.<name>.InvokeRejected` event the way `Run.Throw` did. The error is thrown from inside the sequence's own `invoke()`, so the enclosing kind's event is what fires (e.g. `Run.Sequence.<handlerName>.InvokeRejected` — or nothing, when an enclosing `try` absorbs the throw). Downstream observers that filtered on `Run.Throw.*.InvokeRejected` must switch filters.

  **CLI** (`@telorun/cli`)

  - `telo publish` reads `TELO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Without the env var, publishes to auth-gated registries fail with 401.

  See `apps/registry/plans/registry-auth.md` for the full plan.
