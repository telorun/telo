k8s-runner: add a base-image picker resolved from a filtered Docker Hub tag catalog and validated server-side, and make `pullPolicy` a live base-image freshness control — `always` digest-pins the build so a moved moving-tag (e.g. `latest-slim`) rebuilds. Adds a generic `BaseImageCatalog` + `resolveTagDigest` and a `validateConfig` server hook to runner-core.
