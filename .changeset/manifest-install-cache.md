`telo install` now also persists every imported manifest's YAML to `<entry-dir>/.telo/manifests/` (registry refs under `<namespace>/<name>/<version>/telo.yaml`, HTTP imports under `__http/<host>/<pathname>`). `telo run` registers a new `LocalManifestCacheSource` ahead of the registry / HTTP sources, so production images that ran `telo install` at build time boot with zero registry network I/O — fixing the self-bootstrap loop in the registry image and unblocking air-gapped deploys. Cache misses fall through to the network source transparently; dev runs without a prior install are unchanged. New CLI flag `telo install --registry-url <url>` mirrors `telo run` for consistency.

The reader and writer share a single URL→path function so direct-URL imports of a registry-served manifest (`source: https://registry.telo.run/...`) hit the same cache file as the corresponding `source: namespace/name@version` ref. HTTP URLs with a query string or fragment are disambiguated with a 12-char content hash on the filename so two different manifests never collide. All cache paths are validated to stay under the cache root, guarding against `..` segments in module refs.

- `@telorun/kernel`: adds `LocalManifestCacheSource`, `writeManifestCache`, `cachePathForCanonical`, and `resolveEntryDir` exports.
- `@telorun/cli`: `telo install` writes the manifest cache; `telo run` registers the cache source; new `--registry-url` flag on `telo install`.
