# Changelog

## 0.13.2 - 2026-11-09
### Fixed
* The telo requirement that static checking cannot see is now a `restrictions:` entry carrying its reason, and `requires.telo` holds the measured floor.

## 0.13.1 - 2026-11-08
### Fixed
* Documentation links now point at telo.run pages and hub module pages instead of the repository tree.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-11-06
### Added
* `connectTimeout` is a duration (`2s` when omitted): `30d`, `1h30m` and `250ms` are read, an integer is milliseconds, a malformed or negative literal is refused by `telo check`. A computed value must now be a duration (`!cel "duration('2s')"`), not a string, so a manifest passing a computed string must change. Text with a space before the unit (`5 m`) or around the value is now refused. Requires telo >=0.130.0.

## 0.12.2 - 2026-11-01
### Fixed
* Reformatted the manifest to the canonical layout (short lists and maps in flow style); no change in behaviour.

## 0.12.0 - 2026-10-07
### Added
* Released under the MIT License from this version: the manifest declares license MIT, and the published artifact carries the MIT license text in a LICENSE file at the module root. Versions already published keep the license they shipped with.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-08-23
### Added
* Controllers return their effects from `init()` / `run()` instead of implementing `teardown()`: each allocation is written beside the inverse that undoes it, and the runtime unwinds them last-in-first-out. A failure part-way through startup now recovers what it already allocated — a bound port releases the kernel hold and unregisters the routes, a connection that fails its health check destroys its pool — and the retry starts from a freshly constructed resource. Declares `requires: telo: '>=0.82.0'`, since an older runtime discards what a controller returns and would allocate nothing.

## 0.10.2 - 2026-08-16
### Fixed
* Controllers ship as one bundle per module, selected by PURL fragment, and a module-owned library is resolved at load through the import graph instead of being copied into each dependent's bundle. A shared source file compiled into two bundles was two module scopes, so state a module kept beside its instances silently became two of them.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-08-09
### Added
* metadata.name is now CacheRedis, so the module contributes its kinds under the `CacheRedis.<Kind>` canonical prefix instead of `cache-redis.<Kind>` — a name rather than a slug, in the PascalCase form the manifest grammar asks for. Importers are unaffected: a kind is always written through the import alias the consumer picks (`<Alias>.<Kind>`), and the `exports.kinds` list is unchanged. Only a manifest that names the canonical `<module>.<Kind>` form directly — a legacy bare-string `x-telo-ref`, or a diagnostic matched by its text — sees the new prefix.## 0.9.0 - 2026-08-08
### Added
* Every `x-telo-ref` slot now declares what this module does with the target: `use: dependency` (held and read), `call` (control transfers during the invocation and returns), `detached`, `trigger.inbound`, `trigger.consumer`, or `schema` for a slot that only names a shape. Slots that accepted `Telo.Invocable | Telo.Runnable` through an `anyOf` now say `Telo.Executable`, the new built-in parent of both. Wiring manifests are unchanged — this is schema metadata, and it is what lets `telo check` answer whether control reaches a referenced resource, and when.## 0.8.0 - 2026-08-01
### Added
* The controller now ships inside the module artifact as a bundle (pkg:telo/local/js) instead of being fetched from npm at load. Importing this module needs no npm registry at run time, and its version is a single number again: metadata.version. The kernel builds the controller from source while the module is a working copy, so a checkout needs no build step.## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Reference slots name their target as an alias-qualified kind (`<Alias>.<Kind>`, `Self.<Kind>`, `Telo.<Kind>`) instead of the `<namespace>/<module>#<Kind>` identity string, so a constraint resolves through this module's own `imports:` map and stays pinned to the version it imports. `metadata.namespace` is dropped — a module's location is the ref it is published under, never anything it declares about itself.
### Fixed
* Update controller @telorun/cache-redis to 0.4.1.## 0.6.1 - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
* Rewrite the library and kind descriptions for the hub's semantic search: each one now states what it does in a single paragraph, without kind names, references to the modules that implement it, or wording that only made sense against the module's history. The README is corrected alongside: reference and CEL syntax the analyzer no longer accepts, unpinned version tags, and examples that named fields or kinds that do not exist.
Declare `metadata.categories` — the domain labels the hub groups its browse view by and the editor filters its resource picker with.## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-27
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/cache-redis to 0.4.0.## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-19
### Added
* Declare repository and license in module metadata, published as org.opencontainers.image.* annotations on OCI.## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-12
### Added
* Describe exported resource kinds via metadata.description for semantic discovery.## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-06
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/cache-redis to 0.3.0.## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-20
### Added
* Update controller @telorun/cache-redis to 0.2.0.## 0.1.0
