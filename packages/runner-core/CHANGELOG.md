# @telorun/runner-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e6e8d88: Unify the docker and kubernetes runners behind a `/v1/capabilities` discovery
  endpoint. Runners advertise their own editable config schema; the editor
  collapses the docker-api and k8s adapters into a single capability-driven
  http-runner adapter with managed add/edit/remove/switch runners, and preflights
  required variables/secrets before a run.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dc20d0: Add a Kubernetes runner. Extract backend-neutral `@telorun/runner-core` from docker-runner (shared `/v1` contract, routes, registry, SSE, ring buffers) behind a `RunnerBackend` seam; docker-runner becomes a thin backend over it with no behaviour change. Add `@telorun/k8s-runner`, a `KubernetesBackend` that runs Telo apps as sandboxed Pods (attach-based PTY, hard-ceiling limit clamping, tokenized bundle delivery, per-session ingress, orphan reaping) plus a Helm chart (RBAC, quota, NetworkPolicy) and a CI image job. Add a k8s editor `RunAdapter` via a shared `createHttpRunnerAdapter` factory. Rename the docker image `telorun/telo-runner` → `telorun/docker-runner`.
