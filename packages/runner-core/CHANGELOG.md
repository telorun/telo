# @telorun/runner-core

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d5b8228: Watch sessions: a session can now be a workspace that runs continuously instead
  of one run. One pod holds a shared `/workspace` volume, a `workspace` container
  serving the editor's file routes, one container per application under `telo run
--watch`, and optionally a co-resident agent from the operator's app catalog — so
  an edit costs a kernel reload rather than a pod. Off unless
  `RUNNER_WATCH_SESSIONS` is set; run sessions are unchanged.

  Session status and run outcome become two nouns on one stream. `status` is the
  session's (`starting`/`running`/`suspended`/`stopped`/`failed`), while a new `run`
  event carries one application's generation — so a one-shot Runnable finishing
  leaves the session alive and the next edit starts the next generation. `run`
  events are projected from the kernel debug stream rather than parsed out of a
  terminal, and the CLI now emits `Kernel.RunFailed` for the one case that stream
  did not carry: a manifest that fails to load at all.

  Breaking, and the ripple is the reason the version moves rather than the size of
  it: `RunnerFeatures.io` becomes a list of attach modes; `progress`, `debug`,
  `reachability` and the byte channel are qualified by application (`/io` takes
  `?app=`, and every binary frame gains a stream tag); and the `stdout` / `stderr`
  `RunEvent` variants are deleted — nothing ever emitted them, so they were a
  contract in shape only. Workload output travels the byte channel, as it always
  did in practice.

  `@telorun/debug-wire` gains no code — its README now writes down the four kernel
  events a HOST derives behaviour from (`Kernel.Starting`, `Kernel.Stopped`,
  `Kernel.RunFailed`, `Kernel.PortsResolved`) and the requirement that a stream
  with a replay buffer carry a monotonic `id:` and honour `Last-Event-ID`. The
  dotted event vocabulary is otherwise open; these four are the exception because a
  kernel that omits them leaves a runner with no run outcomes and no way to
  re-route a port, so a second runtime needs them written down.

  The CLI also honours `CLICOLOR_FORCE` for Node's colour libraries, bridging it
  onto `FORCE_COLOR` when that is not already set — one variable now reaches a
  Rust, Go or Node workload alike, and `FORCE_COLOR=0` beside `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1`
  keeps its meaning.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d5b8228]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.4.1

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- c7fdbd9: Move to fastify 5.12, where per-request logging is switched off through the `logController` option instead of the deprecated top-level `disableRequestLogging` (FSTDEP023).

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c1fef72]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.4.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 73ed5ba: Predefined app sessions get their own creation door: `POST /v1/apps/:name/sessions` (`{ env?, ports?, inspect? }`; `404 unknown_app`; same terms gate) replaces the `app` field on `POST /v1/sessions`, whose body schema is strict again (`bundle` + `config` required). Created sessions live in the shared `/v1/sessions` collection (status / DELETE / events / io unchanged)

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 721a241: Operator-predefined app catalog: runners advertise launchable applications on `/v1/capabilities` (`apps`) and `POST /v1/sessions` accepts `app: <name>` instead of a bundle — the runner resolves the image and injects the app's operator env server-side, all from the `RUNNER_APPS` JSON config (no app is built in; runners know nothing about any specific application). Replaces the `TELO_SELF_CONTAINED` sentinel; k8s-runner runs app sessions as direct pods (no image build) under separate `RUNNER_APP_MAX_*` ceilings

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 897c0b9: Surface session port reachability on the endpoint badge instead of the log stream.

  After a session goes running, the runner (`watchReachability` in
  `@telorun/runner-core`, used by the k8s and docker backends) probes each declared
  tcp port and emits a structured `reachability` `RunEvent` per port — `checking`,
  then `reachable`, or `unreachable` after a 30s timeout (flipping back to
  `reachable` if it recovers). The editor renders this on each endpoint link in the
  debug panel: a spinner while checking, a green icon when reachable, a red icon
  when unreachable — turning the loopback-bind / wrong-port failure (previously an
  opaque downstream 502, or a late log line) into live status on the URL itself.

  The badge reflects reachability from the runner to the workload (pod network for
  k8s, published port / container for docker) — a proxy for the common loopback-bind
  failure, not end-to-end health of the public link, and a startup signal rather
  than continuous monitoring (a port that comes up then dies keeps its green icon).

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a125804]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.3.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a8c99ab]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.2.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bc2eeff: Session ids are now short 12-character base32 strings (e.g. `k7m3qx9r2abc`) instead of 36-character UUIDs. The shorter id keeps `<id>.<domain>` session hostnames and `telo-run-<id>` container/pod names compact while staying DNS- and Kubernetes-name-safe. Generated centrally via `generateSessionId`; ids remain opaque to clients.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2558e41: k8s-runner: add a base-image picker resolved from a filtered Docker Hub tag catalog and validated server-side, and make `pullPolicy` a live base-image freshness control — `always` digest-pins the build so a moved moving-tag (e.g. `latest-slim`) rebuilds. Adds a generic `BaseImageCatalog` + `resolveTagDigest` and a `validateConfig` server hook to runner-core.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8133912: Retain exited sessions long enough for the editor to re-attach and replay a run's console + inspection history after a page reload. The exit-eviction TTL default goes from 5 minutes to 4 hours, the max retained sessions default from 8 to 32, and at capacity the registry now evicts the oldest _terminal_ session before rejecting a new run (live sessions are never evicted), so a long TTL never blocks a new run.
- 8133912: Add operator-defined, server-enforced usage terms. A runner advertises `terms` on `/v1/capabilities` (sourced from `RUNNER_TERMS_FILE` or inline `RUNNER_TERMS_BODY`, with the version defaulting to a content hash) and rejects `POST /v1/sessions` with `428 terms_required` unless the client sends the `x-telo-accepted-terms` header matching the current version. runner-core gains `loadTermsFromEnv`, the `RunnerTerms` type, the `ACCEPTED_TERMS_HEADER` constant, and the `terms` capability field. docker-runner reads terms from the environment (off by default); k8s-runner wires them through the Helm chart via a terms ConfigMap.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d59e847]
  - @telorun/debug-wire@0.1.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e6e8d88: Unify the docker and kubernetes runners behind a `/v1/capabilities` discovery
  endpoint. Runners advertise their own editable config schema; the editor
  collapses the docker-api and k8s adapters into a single capability-driven
  http-runner adapter with managed add/edit/remove/switch runners, and preflights
  required variables/secrets before a run.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dc20d0: Add a Kubernetes runner. Extract backend-neutral `@telorun/runner-core` from docker-runner (shared `/v1` contract, routes, registry, SSE, ring buffers) behind a `RunnerBackend` seam; docker-runner becomes a thin backend over it with no behaviour change. Add `@telorun/k8s-runner`, a `KubernetesBackend` that runs Telo apps as sandboxed Pods (attach-based PTY, hard-ceiling limit clamping, tokenized bundle delivery, per-session ingress, orphan reaping) plus a Helm chart (RBAC, quota, NetworkPolicy) and a CI image job. Add a k8s editor `RunAdapter` via a shared `createHttpRunnerAdapter` factory. Rename the docker image `telorun/telo-runner` → `telorun/docker-runner`.
