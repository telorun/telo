Migrate Docker image publishing to a per-runtime-repo scheme with variant + multi-arch tagging.

**Kernel image** moves from `telorun/telo` to `telorun/node`, reserving the namespace for future polyglot kernels (`telorun/rust`, `telorun/go`). The previous monolithic image is split into four variants per release:

- `telorun/node:<v>` / `telorun/node:<v>-slim` — lean variants, no Rust toolchain.
- `telorun/node:<v>-rust-<rust-version>` / `telorun/node:<v>-rust-<rust-version>-slim` — opt-in Rust toolchain layered on top.

Rolling tags (`latest`, `<major>`, `<major>.<minor>`) compose with the variant suffixes. Release tags are immutable; pin to exact versions for reproducible builds. Release images are multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`). Dev tags (`sha-<short>-*`) appear on every main-branch push, slim variants only.

**Lambda base images** newly published as `telorun/lambda-node-managed:<lambda-version>` (managed nodejs runtime) and `telorun/lambda-node-custom:<lambda-version>` (custom `provided.al2023` runtime). Both pre-install `@telorun/lambda` and its workspace deps at `${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}`; user images derive from them and add only their manifest + install root. The `-node-` segment in the repo name reserves the namespace for future `telorun/lambda-rust-*` images.

**CI**: docker publishing now runs from `.github/workflows/publish-docker.yml`, called by `publish.yml` after `changesets/action` actually publishes packages. Per-image gating reads `outputs.publishedPackages` so kernel images rebuild only when `@telorun/cli` bumps and lambda images only when `@telorun/lambda` bumps.
