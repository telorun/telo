# `Mcp.HttpEndpoint`

> Examples below assume `mcp-server` is imported as `Mcp` and `http-server` as `Http`.

Mounts an MCP Streamable-HTTP listener at a path on an `Http.Server`. One
endpoint serves multiple concurrent clients; each client owns its own MCP SDK
`Server` instance keyed by the `Mcp-Session-Id` header.

## Schema

```yaml
kind: Mcp.HttpEndpoint
metadata: { name: <EndpointName> }
serverInfo:
  name: <advertised-server-name>
  version: <semver>
instructions: |                              # optional — primer for the client's LLM
  Free-form text surfaced on `initialize`.
tools: [<Mcp.Tools bundle names>]
resources: [<Mcp.Resources bundle names>]   # v2 runtime
prompts: [<Mcp.Prompts bundle names>]       # v2 runtime
```

### `instructions`

Optional free-form string carried on the SDK `Server`'s `instructions` option.
Compatible MCP clients (Claude Desktop, etc.) surface it to the LLM as system
context on every session. Use it to teach the model what your server is, what
its tools mean, and how to use them — onboarding without requiring the LLM to
call a separate "help" tool first. The same string is returned to every session
that initializes against the endpoint.

## Mounting on `Http.Server`

```yaml
kind: Http.Server
metadata: { name: Web }
port: 8080
mounts:
  - { path: /v1, type: <App>.Rest }     # your existing REST API
  - { path: /mcp, type: <App>.McpHttp } # the MCP endpoint
```

`Mcp.HttpEndpoint` duck-types the `register(app, prefix)` signature that
`Http.Server`'s mount loop already calls on `Http.Api`, so it integrates with
zero changes to the host server. A REST API and an MCP endpoint can share the
same port without either being aware of the other.

## Session model

The `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` from the MCP SDK is per-session and
`Server.connect(transport)` is 1:1, so each new client gets its own pair:

| Request                                                           | Behaviour                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST without `Mcp-Session-Id` AND body is an `initialize` request | Mint session UUID, build fresh SDK Server + transport, register in session map, return UUID via `Mcp-Session-Id` response header. |
| POST/GET/DELETE with known `Mcp-Session-Id`                       | Route to that session's transport.                          |
| Any request with unknown `Mcp-Session-Id`                         | 404 with a JSON-RPC error envelope.                         |

`StreamableHTTPServerTransport.onclose` removes the session from the map. On
`Http.Server` shutdown, the endpoint's `onClose` hook closes every active
session.

## v1 limits

- **No idle session GC.** Sessions live until `Http.Server` closes. Long-running endpoints will accumulate sessions over time. Idle expiry / max-sessions cap is v2 work.
- **No auth.** Authentication is the host `Http.Server`'s concern (CORS, reverse-proxy auth, future Telo middleware kinds).
- **No `resources` / `prompts` runtime.** Bundles are accepted but must be empty.

## Soft vs hard failures

The same distinction as `Mcp.StdioServer` applies — see [Mcp.Tools](./tools.md):

- `result.isError: true` — handler succeeded but content describes an upstream failure (LLM reads it as natural language).
- `catches:` — handler threw an `InvokeError`; the entry maps it to a JSON-RPC error response.
